# Introduction

### Welcome to epann

**epann** is a neuroevolution framework for designing artificial life experiments using variants of the HyperNEAT algorithm. 

The author recognizes the existence of other [libraries](http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/neat_software/) that already implement many features of this research pipeline, however maintains the perspective that better understanding can come from writing it yourself. 

### Overview

**epann** provides a general purpose environment for generating Compositional Pattern Producing Network (CPPN) genomes that map to agent phenotype artificial neural networks that can be trained and optimized on benchmark machine learning tasks. 

Most of the algorithms used in **epann** come from the works of Kenneth O. Stanley (UCF), Bruno Olshausen (Redwood Institute), as well as my colleagues at the Machine Perception & Cognitive Robotics Laboratory (FAU), and they will be cited as such when appropriate.
