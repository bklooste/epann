As a consequence of constructing this plane, individual nodes within a CPPN can be defined with coordinates on that plane. \n",

    "The purpose of our CPPN genome is to allow us to more compactly represent an agent's phenotype with an indirect encoding. The way were are able to do this is by treating a genome as a function of a possible connection in the phenotype. More specifically, A CPPN genome samples a possible connection between two nodes, which are represented within a substrate as a pair of coordinates, and uses them as inputs to the CPPN network. In return, we can receive a property of that connection in the phenotype - for example, the weight of that connection. "
