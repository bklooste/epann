    "The package is itself a practice in package management and maintenance specific to the research goals of the author in the fields of machine learning, artificial life, neuroevolution, and theoretical neuroscience. The author recognizes the existence of other [libraries](http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/neat_software/) that already implement many features of this research pipeline, however maintains the (misguided?) perspective that proper understanding can come from writing it yourself. \n",
