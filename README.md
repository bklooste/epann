# epann
Evolutionary Plastic Artificial Neural Networks

### General:

**epann** is a library for implementing for performing neuroevolution experiments with indirectly encoded genomes, namely Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPN).
Genomes can be mapped to functional artificial neural network phenotypes for artificial life and machine learning experiments.

### Purpose:
1. Implement HyperNEAT variants for evolving populations of neural networks entirely in Python.
2. Gain a better understanding of package maintenance and deployment through direct practice. 
3. Create a general purpose research framework for applying neuroevolution and non-objective search to a variety of experiments inside the MPCR Lab, FAU.
4. Track experiment progress with effective documentation towards personal research goals. 

### Getting Started:

You can find a collection of tutorials meant to introduce the major algorithms and features of the package.
