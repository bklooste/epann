# epann
Evolutionary Plastic Artificial Neural Networks

### General:

**epann** is a library for designing neuroevolution experiments using variants of the HyperNEAT algorithm. 

### Goals:

1. Create and maintain a general purpose research framework for implementing neuroevolution and non-objective search in machine learning experiments. 
2. Track experiments with effective documentation towards personal research goals and potential use across MPCR lab projects.
3. Practice in package management. 

### Dependencies:

* TensorFlow
* OpenAI Universe

### Getting Started:

* Start with an **[Introduction to epann](https://github.com/chadwcarlson/epann/blob/master/epann/docs/getting_started/01introduction.md)**.
* Explore the rest of the **[Documentation](https://github.com/chadwcarlson/epann/tree/master/epann/docs)**.



### Algorithms

Most of the algorithms used in the library come from the works of Kenneth O. Stanley (UCF), Bruno Olshausen (Redwood Institute), as well as my colleagues at the Machine Perception & Cognitive Robotics Laboratory (FAU), and they will be cited as such when appropriate.
