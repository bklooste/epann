Evolutionary Plastic Artificial Neural Networks

##### A Python package for implementing Compositional Pattern Producing Network (CPPN) variants for indirectly encoding artificial neural networks for neuroevolution and artificial life experiments.

- Purpose:
1. Greater understanding of the HyperNEAT algorithm and indirect encoding variants for evolving a populations of neural networks.
2. Practice in package management.
3. General purpose research pipeline for appyling EPANN neuroevolution techniques to a variety of environments.
4. Dissertation code and documentations.

### Tutorials
