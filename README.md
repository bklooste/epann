# epann
Evolutionary Plastic Artificial Neural Networks

### General:

**epann** is a library for designing neuroevolution experiments using variants of the HyperNEAT algorithm. 

### Purpose:
1. Implement HyperNEAT variants for evolving populations of neural networks entirely in Python.
2. Gain a better understanding of package maintenance and deployment through direct practice. 
3. Create a general purpose research framework for applying neuroevolution and non-objective search to a variety of experiments inside the MPCR Lab, FAU.
4. Track experiment progress with effective documentation towards personal research goals in the fields of machine learning, artificial life, neuroevolution, and theoretical neuroscience.

### Getting Started:
